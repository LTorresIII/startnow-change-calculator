*Change Calculator*

Intro-
	At the last minute, you've been asked to work on team developing a module for an automated check-out system of a nationally-based grocery store chain. 
	The module your team is building will accept two inputs: the total amount of the sale and the amount tendered by the customer. 
	Then, it should calculate the amount of change due in dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies.
	This should give you a visual idea of what is required. Since it is just a prototype mockup, you are free to modify the layout and styles as you see fit. 
	You probably will want to add a Calculate button as well.

Instructions-
	Open up a terminal
	Open the project folder in VS Code using the following command: code ~/oca/startnow-change-calculator
	Run: npm install.
	Write code (in index.html and main.js) to make the tests pass.
	Run: npm test to run the tests and see your progress.
	Hint: the modulo operator might come in handy for this assignment
	Create a styles.css and add additional styling as needed.
	For this project, you have creative license to define the layout .css anyway you want. You can use Bootstrap, a different css framework of your choosing or go completely custom. 
	Just be creative!
